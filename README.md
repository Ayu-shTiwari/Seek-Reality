## **WORK SUMMARY**

SeekReality is a multi-modal deepfake detection platform for images, videos, and audio. It combines state-of-the-art AI models (MesoNet, MesoLSTM) with a modern web interface (React + Flask) and secure authentication (Auth0). The platform is designed for real-time, user-friendly verification of media to combat misinformation.


## **1. Motivation Behind the Project**


SeekReality was motivated by the growing threat of deepfakes, which erode digital trust through sophisticated media manipulation. Key drivers include:

**Misinformation Surge**: AI-generated deepfakes (fake videos, images, audio) threaten journalism, reputations, and security (e.g., voice scams).
**Inadequate Tools**: Existing detection tools are often single-modal, slow, or inaccessible to non-experts.
**Restoring Trust**: SeekReality aims to provide a user-friendly, real-time platform to verify media, empowering users to combat misinformation.

## **2. Type of Project**


Development cum Research Project:

**Hybrid Nature**: Combines software development and AI research within Computer Science Engineering.
**Domain Focus**: Centers on machine learning, computer vision, audio processing, and web development.
**Core Objective**: Develops a multi-modal deepfake detection platform for images, videos, and audio to combat misinformation.
**Academic Context**: Fulfills partial requirements for a Bachelor of Technology degree, emphasizing theoretical and practical contributions.
**Technical Scope**: Integrates AI models (MesoNet, MesoLSTM, ) with a React-Flask web application and Auth0 authentication.
**Practical Application**: Designed for real-world use in journalism, content moderation, and security, enhancing digital trust.
**Dual Purpose**: Balances academic research with a deployable solution addressing technical and societal challenges.

### **3. Critical Analysis of Research Papers and Technologies Learned**

**Research Papers Reviewed**:

**Deepfake Video Detection Based on ****MesoNet**** with Preprocessing Module**: Highlighted MesoNetâ€™s effectiveness with preprocessing for video deepfake detection, but overlooked real-time constraints and multi-modal applicability, limiting its scope for SeekRealityâ€™s broader goals.
**A Review on the Long Short-Term Memory Model**: Provided a comprehensive overview of LSTMâ€™s theoretical foundations and applications, emphasizing its role in sequence modeling (e.g., time series, and video processing).
**The Effect of Deep Learning Methods on Deepfake Audio Detection for Digital Investigation**: Explored CNN-based audio detection with spectrogram features, validating SeekRealityâ€™s approach, but lacked real-time focus and generalizability, constraining its relevance for scalable deployment.
## **Technologies Learned:**

**MesoNet****/****MesoLSTM**** for Deepfake Detection**: Praised for lightweight, accurate image and video analysis, but computationally intensive for videos and vulnerable to advanced deepfakes, requiring optimization for SeekRealityâ€™s real-time needs.
**React and Flask for Web Development**: Lauded for enabling a responsive, modular platform, but Flaskâ€™s scalability limitations under high traffic highlight the need for cloud-based enhancements in SeekRealityâ€™s architecture.
## **4. Overall Design of the Project**


**Architecture**:

**Frontend**: React.js UI for media uploads, result display, and account management.
**Backend**: Flask server for API handling, preprocessing, and model inference.
**AI Core**: Meso4 (images), MesoLSTM (videos),
**Authentication**: Auth0 with Google Sign-In for secure access.


**Modularity**:


Separate modules for frontend, backend, and AI models enable independent updates.
Standardized preprocessing (face detection, spectrograms) ensures consistency.
**Diagrams**:

Use Case: Shows user interactions (login, upload, view results).
Sequence: Details media upload to result display workflow.
Class: Incorrectly included (healthcare-related); needs SeekReality-specific version.
**Scalability/Security**: Flask supports moderate loads; Auth0 and encryption ensure security. Cloud deployment proposed for scaling.

## **5. Features Built and Programming Languages Used**


**Features**:

**Multi-Modal Detection**: Image (Meso4), video (MesoLSTM), with confidence scores.
**Secure Authentication**: Auth0 with Google Sign-In.
**Explainable Results**: Visual/audio cues and confidence metrics.
**Web Interface**: React portal for uploads, results, and history.
**Real-time Feedback**: Immediate results with progress indicators.
**Reporting**: Downloadable detection reports.
**Languages/Technologies**:


**Python**: Flask, TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy, OpenCV.
**JavaScript**: React.js for UI.
**HTML/CSS**: Web structure, Tailwind CSS for styling.



## **6. Proposed Methodology**


**Data Collection**: Kaggle datasets

**Preprocessing**:

Images/Videos: Face detection, resize to 256x256, normalize to range [0,1].
Audio: Mel-spectrograms/MFCCs.
**Model Training**:

Meso4: CNN for images.
MesoLSTM: CNN+LSTM for videos.
**Integration**:

React frontend for user interaction.
Flask backend for API and inference.
Auth0 for security.
**Testing**: Unit, integration, system, and user acceptance tests.


**Future Work**: Cloud scaling, social media integration, model tuning.


## **7. Algorithm/Description of the Work**


## **Image-Level Detection (Meso4)**


**Input**: Single image.
**Preprocess**: Resize to 256Ã—256, normalize to [0, 1].
**Prediction**: Pass through Meso4 model.
**Output**: If score > 0.6 â†’ **Real**, else â†’ **Fake**.





## ** Video-Level Detection (****MesoLSTM****)**


**Input**: Video file.
**Frame Extraction**: Select ~30 key frames.
**Preprocess**: Resize and normalize frames.
**Feature Extraction**: Use Meso4 for each frame.
**Temporal ****Modeling**: Feed features into LSTM.
**Output**: If score > 0.6 â†’ **Real**, else â†’ **Fake**.
